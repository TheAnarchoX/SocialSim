# SocialSim Data Governance Policy

**Version**: 1.0  
**Effective Date**: December 31, 2025  
**Last Updated**: December 31, 2025  
**Status**: Active

## 1. Overview

This document establishes the data governance policies for SocialSim, a social network simulation platform. These policies ensure compliance with GDPR, CCPA, and industry best practices while supporting the platform's research and simulation objectives.

## 2. Data Classification

### 2.1 Data Categories

| Category | Description | Examples | Retention | Sensitivity |
|----------|-------------|----------|-----------|-------------|
| **Identity Data** | User identification information | DID, handle, email, display name | Account lifetime + 30 days | High |
| **Profile Data** | User-provided profile information | Bio, avatar, location, website | Account lifetime | Medium |
| **Content Data** | User-generated content | Posts, comments, media | Account lifetime or until deleted | Medium |
| **Engagement Data** | Interaction records | Likes, reposts, bookmarks | Account lifetime | Low |
| **Relationship Data** | Social connections | Follows, blocks, mutes | Account lifetime | Medium |
| **Behavioral Data** | Usage patterns | Activity timestamps, session data | 90 days (detailed), 2 years (aggregated) | Medium |
| **Simulation Data** | Agent behavior and generated content | Simulated posts, synthetic interactions | Simulation lifetime | Low |
| **Audit Data** | System and compliance logs | Access logs, change history | 7 years | High |

### 2.2 Simulated vs. Real Data

SocialSim distinguishes between:

- **Real User Data**: Data from actual users interacting with the platform
  - Subject to full GDPR/CCPA compliance
  - Requires explicit consent
  - Full rights (access, erasure, portability) apply

- **Simulated Agent Data**: Synthetic data generated by simulation
  - Clearly marked with `is_simulated = true`
  - Not subject to individual privacy rights
  - Research exemption may apply
  - Governed by research ethics policies

## 3. Data Retention Policy

### 3.1 Retention Schedule

| Data Type | Active Retention | Archive Period | Total Retention | Destruction Method |
|-----------|------------------|----------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| User accounts | Until deletion | 30 days post-deletion | Varies | Cryptographic erasure |
| Posts/content | Until deletion | 30 days post-deletion | Varies | Soft delete → hard delete |
| Engagement records | Account lifetime | N/A | Account lifetime | Cascade delete |
| Relationship history | 1 year detailed | Archive to cold storage | 7 years | Periodic purge |
| Metrics snapshots | 1 year | Archive to cold storage | 7 years | Periodic purge |
| Consent records | 7 years minimum | N/A | 7 years | Secure deletion |
| Audit logs | 1 year hot | 6 years cold | 7 years | Secure deletion |
| Simulation data | Simulation duration | 90 days post-simulation | As needed | Bulk deletion |

### 3.2 Archival Process

**Stakeholder Decision**: Archive relationship history older than 1 year to cold storage.

**Process**:
1. Monthly job identifies records with `occurred_at < NOW() - INTERVAL '1 year'`
2. Records exported to compressed JSON format
3. Uploaded to cold storage (S3 Glacier / Azure Archive)
4. Original records marked with `archived_at` timestamp
5. After 30-day verification period, original records hard deleted
6. Archive manifest maintained in PostgreSQL for retrieval

**Archive Format**:
```json
{
  "archive_id": "uuid",
  "archive_date": "2025-12-31T00:00:00Z",
  "record_count": 10000,
  "date_range": {
    "start": "2024-01-01",
    "end": "2024-12-31"
  },
  "checksum": "sha256:...",
  "records": [...]
}
```

## 4. Legal Basis for Processing

### 4.1 Processing Purposes and Legal Basis

| Purpose | Legal Basis (GDPR Art. 6) | CCPA Category |
|---------|---------------------------|---------------|
| Account creation & authentication | Contract (6.1.b) | Business purpose |
| Content display & delivery | Contract (6.1.b) | Business purpose |
| Social features (follow, like) | Contract (6.1.b) | Business purpose |
| Analytics & metrics | Legitimate interest (6.1.f) | Business purpose |
| Personalization | Consent (6.1.a) | Sale (requires opt-out) |
| Research & simulation | Consent (6.1.a) or Legitimate interest | Research exemption |
| Safety & security | Legitimate interest (6.1.f) | Business purpose |
| Legal compliance | Legal obligation (6.1.c) | Business purpose |

### 4.2 Consent Management

Consent is required for:
- Personalized recommendations (beyond basic functionality)
- Analytics for product improvement
- Research participation
- Marketing communications
- Third-party data sharing
- Cross-border data transfers (to non-adequate countries)

**Consent Records Table**: See `consent_records` in PostgreSQL schema.

## 5. Data Subject Rights

### 5.1 Rights Implementation

| Right | GDPR Article | Implementation | Response Time |
|-------|--------------|----------------|---------------|
| **Access** | Art. 15 | Export all user data via API | 30 days |
| **Rectification** | Art. 16 | Edit profile/settings UI | Immediate |
| **Erasure** | Art. 17 | Account deletion flow | 30 days |
| **Restriction** | Art. 18 | Account suspension | Immediate |
| **Portability** | Art. 20 | JSON export of user data | 30 days |
| **Objection** | Art. 21 | Opt-out of processing | Immediate |

### 5.2 Request Processing

Data subject requests tracked in `data_subject_requests` table:

1. **Intake**: Request received via support channel or API
2. **Verification**: Identity verification required
3. **Assessment**: Determine scope and feasibility
4. **Execution**: Fulfill request within 30 days
5. **Notification**: Confirm completion to user
6. **Documentation**: Log in processing records

### 5.3 Right to Erasure (Hard Delete)

**Process**:
1. Soft delete user record (`deleted_at` timestamp)
2. 30-day grace period for recovery
3. Hard delete cascade:
   - Remove all posts, media, engagements
   - Remove from Neo4j graph
   - Remove from search indices
   - Anonymize audit logs (retain for compliance)
4. Generate deletion certificate
5. Confirm to user via last known email

**Exceptions** (data retained):
- Aggregate, anonymized statistics
- Audit logs (anonymized)
- Legal hold data
- Public interest archives

## 6. Data Security

### 6.1 Security Controls

| Control | Implementation |
|---------|----------------|
| Encryption at rest | AES-256 for databases, S3 SSE |
| Encryption in transit | TLS 1.3 required |
| Access control | RBAC with principle of least privilege |
| Authentication | OAuth 2.0 + MFA for admin |
| Audit logging | All data access logged |
| Backup encryption | Encrypted backups with separate keys |
| Key management | Azure Key Vault / AWS KMS |

### 6.2 Data Minimization

Principles:
1. Collect only necessary data
2. Delete data when no longer needed
3. Anonymize where possible
4. Aggregate for analytics (not individual tracking)

### 6.3 Breach Response

1. **Detection**: Automated monitoring + manual reporting
2. **Containment**: Isolate affected systems within 1 hour
3. **Assessment**: Determine scope within 24 hours
4. **Notification**: 
   - Supervisory authority: 72 hours (GDPR Art. 33)
   - Affected users: Without undue delay if high risk
5. **Remediation**: Address root cause
6. **Documentation**: Incident report retained 7 years

## 7. Third-Party Data Sharing

### 7.1 Current Third Parties

| Party | Purpose | Data Shared | Legal Basis | DPA Signed |
|-------|---------|-------------|-------------|------------|
| Cloud Provider (Azure/AWS) | Infrastructure | All | Contract | Yes |
| CDN Provider | Media delivery | Media URLs | Contract | Yes |
| Analytics (if applicable) | Usage metrics | Anonymized usage | Legitimate interest | Yes |

### 7.2 AT Protocol Federation

**Stakeholder Decision**: Federation deferred to Phase 3.

When enabled:
- Public posts may federate to external PDS instances
- User DIDs exposed to federation network
- Users must consent to federation separately
- Withdrawal requires removal request to federated instances

## 8. Research Data

### 8.1 Research Exemption

Simulated data may qualify for research exemption under:
- GDPR Art. 89 (safeguards for research)
- CCPA research exemption (Cal. Civ. Code § 1798.140(e))

**Requirements**:
1. Research purpose clearly documented
2. Technical safeguards in place
3. No individual targeting based on research
4. Results published in aggregate only

### 8.2 Simulation Data Handling

- All simulated agents marked `is_simulated = true`
- Simulated DIDs use distinct prefix: `did:plc:sim*`
- Simulated handles use distinct domain: `*.socialsim.local`
- No mixing of real user data in simulation scenarios
- Simulation data clearly labeled in all exports
